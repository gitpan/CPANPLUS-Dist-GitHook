SYNOPSIS
      # CPANPLUS configuration

      cpanp> s conf dist_type CPANPLUS::Dist::GitHook

      cpanp> s save

      # Git::CPAN::Hook configuration

DESCRIPTION
    CPANPLUS::Dist::GitHook integrates Philippe Bruhat's Git::CPAN::Hook
    module into CPANPLUS.

    Commits are made after any "install" or "uninstall" that CPANPLUS
    undertakes.

METHODS
    The following methods are provided. They are not meant to be called
    directly by the user.

    "install"
        Called to install a distribution. This will in turn call the parent
        install method, check the return status and call Git::CPAN::Hook's
        "commit" method.

    "uninstall"
        Called to uninstall a distribution. This will in turn call the
        parent uninstall method, check the return status and call
        Git::CPAN::Hook's "commit" method.
